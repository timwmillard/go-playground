# Go Playground

[The Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/) is awesome but sometime you want to play our with Go code in your IDE and test thirdparty packages.

This package provides a quick way to play with Go and reset again.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/timwmillard/go-playground.git
```

Play around with Go code.

Then once finished ...

```sh
git checkout .
```

to reset to blank playground.
